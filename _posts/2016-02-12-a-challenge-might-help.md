Inspired by [Jennifer Dewalt's](http://www.jenniferdewalt.com/) and [Jeremy Monroe's](https://medium.com/ruby-on-rails/how-i-finally-learned-rails-95e9b832675b#.xa03vm6x1) projects to learn programming, I decided to make some challenges myself. I do have some knowledge about Ruby, Python, Git and tests, but nothing very deep. I intend to improve my skills as a web developer by learning something new and writing about it here everyday and developing a small project every 2 weeks (I wish it could be every week, but college drains my energy, so I'm trying to be realistic here).

You can see the list of the projects [here](../projects).

Good luck to me :D
