It's a scary greek symbol when you first see it. It's an adorable helper when you get to know it. Mathematicians do have their way on scarying the newbie souls away. But don't let the fancy talk fool you: Math is not like that. Take a long breathe and look at it from a different point of view. You'll see the beauty disguised as a witch.

I have a bright friend who couldn't work with fractions in high school, she was afraid of them. So I imagine it doesn't only happen to me. Summation was my first _hide away point_* in college. I was decided that I was never going to learn it. Not that I had ever even tried to. I had seen that symbol in movies about geniouses and in Feynman's books, that was pro stuff in my head. I was blind by prejudice. And, let's be honest, by ego too. I didn't want to feel dumb, so I didn't put myself in a position where I could fail. Yeah, that was the actual dumb behavior, I see that now.

Turns out, summation is nothing more than a shortcut for the sum of a sequence. If you want to sum up all the numerals from 1 to 735 it gets very long to write, so summation makes it smaller.

This is the structure.

* `n`, the number above the sigma, is the last number of the sequence. 
* `x`, the number under the sigma, is the first number of the sequence. 
* `i`, the number on the side, is the result we want.

See the example:

We set `a` to `5` and `x` to `1` and calculate `i`. Easy like a breeze, right?

We can turn the `i` into an expression, and it won't affect how the summation works:

See? It's just a sum! That's the very basic thing we all learned before we were even allowed to use pens in school, it just uses a cool outfit in college. Now see: I spent months of my life avoiding this, which caused me bad outcomes in class. I imagine how many things I had avoided and/or am currently ignoring just for being afraid of not being able to do. All those things that could be simple if I would give myself the chance to try it, to really try it, go to the source and understand it without being afraid of feeling dumb.

Let's not do this anymore. It's not cool. Let's be free to learn new stuff. Let's be cool.
