			<p>"Article" is an element, first introduced in HTML5, for the purpose of relieving "div" fatigue and overuse. An article element might represent a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, a blog entry, a user-submitted comment, an interactive widget or gadget, or any other independent item of content. When article elements are nested, the inner article should be related to the contents of the outer article.</p>
			<p>The real reason my brother FaceTimed me in Whole Foods: He brought his iPad with him specifically so he could show our dad how FaceTime worked. Suffice to say, dad was impressed; When he was my brother’s age, there was no video conferencing from the grocery store to a family member back at home to check and see if you had the right brand of pasta sauce.</p>
			<p>Pretentiousness aside, if you actually think about it, it’s kind of amazing that someone can have a video conference call over Wi-Fi in the middle of a grocery store with someone else anywhere in the world. Our generation often finds it frustrating and baffling that our parents struggle to understand the same technology that comes so natural to us, but if we actually stop to think about it, that’s because this stuff didn’t exist for the greater part of our parents’ lives.</p>
			<p>Even though there is only five years difference between my brother and I, he cannot remember a time before the internet, while I can. Yet, I can’t remember a time before television, but my parents can. Years down the road when I have kids that are in their teens and twenties, what will the technology gap look like then?</p>
			<p>“Remember how I was telling you about that thing called the Internet? Well, back in the year 2011 when your mom was in her twenties, she wrote stuff on this thing called a blog …”</p>
			<p>“Mommy, what’s this brick thing?” … “Sweetie, its called an iPhone. I got this one in the year of 2009. It was the top-of-the-line smartphone at the time, touchscreen too!” … “What’s a smartphone?”</p>
