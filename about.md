    <p>After some wander, I finally got in the Information Technology course at the Rio Grande do Norte Federal University (UFRN), where my Computing academic history starts. Even though I've been taking a superficial look at this stuff for some time already, what makes me think I love it.</p>
    <p>I co-founded the <a href="http://brasil.pyladies.com/">PyLadies Brazil</a> and it was one of the best experiences in my life so far. It's amazing to see how many people this community is helping - myself included. It led me to my first talk, which was at <a href="http://2014.pythonbrasil.org.br/schedule/python-in-society/pyladies-uma-iniciativa-que-promove-a-diversidade-na-comunidade-python.html">Python Brasil [10]</a>, I was super nervous but loved it, so I'm looking foward to present more talks. I also organized the RuPy Natal conference, when I had the chance to meet a lot of awesome people.</p>
    <p>So far, I had some contact with Ruby, Python, C, HTML, CSS and JavaScript, what means that those are probably going to be the main subjects in my <a href="/blog/">blog</a>. Feel free to send me feedback and sugestions. Hope you find something useful to you around there :D</p>
